Way to calibrate potentiometer(Actuator position)
1. Go to hard stop, where we know the actuator length.
2. Open Sensing>>LinearPos.
3. Set the actuator Position1_m with the known value.
4. Set Pot_calibration 1 and back to 0.
5. Move to another known positon (note that this position should be achieved
   by motor position) and set the Position2_m with it(read UI).
6. Set Pot_calibration 2 and back to 0

- get 2 types of joint position
- without torque feedback, find kp & kd for both collocated, non-collocated
- sys id for outer mass, outer damping
